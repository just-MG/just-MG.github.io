                I wanted to fill this space with some AI-generated text - I thought about asking CODEX to discuss the morality
                of wars [in a funky way of course], and well, I did get the answer in the most fashonable way:
            </p>
            <p>
            <pre style="text-align: left; color: antiquewhite; background-color: lightslategray">
the following is a script for a musical theatre, where two characters argue about the morality of wars:

A: I don't think war is right.

B: I don't think war is wrong.

A: I think war is wrong.

B: I think war is right.

A: I think war is wrong.

B: I think war is right.

A: I think war is wrong.

B: I think war is right.

A: I think war is wrong.

                yeah, so I think we're gonna have to wait until chat GPT comes back becuase well, this one won't take us
                far. What surprises me the most is the lack of conclusions after such a fruitful debate...
